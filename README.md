Todo:
-----
Please add to this as you work your way through!

- [x] Have players select which starting points they'd like to begin with
  - [x] Store these selections
- [x] Have players customise, select and purchase ships
  - [x] Store these purchases in multi-dimentional arrays
- [ ] Have players place ship(s) initially
  - [ ] Figure out how to display some kind of indicator in MathBox
  - [ ] Store the ships' positions in their respective sub-arrays
- [ ] Figure out how rest of gameplay will be presented
- [ ] This is just the Leaning Scenario - add options for other game types
- [ ] Add extra features: 
  - Planets (with gravity that you have to account for)
  - Fuel (maybe you can refuel on planets - a use for Cargo pods)
  - HTML5 local storage (store a game until needed again)
  - Multiplayer modes
  - Play online ([together.js](https://togetherjs.com/) might sort of do what we want)
